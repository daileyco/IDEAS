# IDEAS-Computational-Workshop-2019
Interdisciplinary Disease Ecology Across Scales
May 13 - 17

  This repository serves to host all files associated with the 2019 Interdisciplinary Disease Ecology Across Scales (IDEAS) / Center for the Ecology of Infectious Diseases (CEID) Computational Workshop. 

  The workshop consists of two (2) sections: Scientific Programming [Workshop I] and Mathematical Models of Infectious Diseases [Workshop II]. 

  The associated materials can also be found at one of the instructor's (Dr. John Drake) webpage (https://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/drakelab/). 

  The given Writeup_DAILEY.RMD serves as an amalgamation of all exercises from both workshop sections and is used to generate the Writeup_DAILEY.HTML which is also published using RPubs.com (http://rpubs.com/daileyco/IDEAS_computational_workshop_WRITEUP).
